It shows the total number of chats, total number of messages, the messages that had thumbs up from the users and the messages that had thumbs down.

### General Notes


* Analytics data is delayed by 1 day, as it updates at the previous day’s data.
* Data is stored once the user is on a specific subscription (Topics and Sentiment data will only be available since the user upgrades, any data for dates before upgrade will not be available).
* Data is shown per chat in Activity Tab for users too, and the aggregation is shown in Analytics Tab (topics, sentiment and thumbs down).
* Analytics can be shown as a Pie Chart or Graph.
