The Credit Limit is activated when you want to set the maximum limit of credits to be used by this chatbot from the credits available on the team.

***DANGER ZONE***

The actions done in the section aren’t reversible. If you deleted the chatbot or the conversations, you can’t retrieve them moving forward.

### AI

This is the most important section when it comes to the behavior of the chatbot and how it answers the users’ questions.

This section contains the model of the LLM, the instructions prompt, the temperature of the AI, and the auto training.

### Model

You can choose the model you want the chatbot to use when it answers the users. OpenAI, Claude and Gemini are available to be used.

### Instructions


This section is important to set the behavior of the chatbot when it answers the questions of the users. The instructions prompt should include some text to describe to the chatbot how to answer specific questions, what to do when the answer isn’t provided in the sources, when to provide URLs. 

You should add that the chatbot should rely on the sources when answering the questions, and not to answer any question not mentioned in the training data to avoid providing misleading information.

The instructions added allow you to customize your chatbot's personality and style. Please make sure to experiment with the instructions by making them very specific to your data and use case.

The instructions area has an option to add a custom prompt or a pre-defined example of instructions

### Temperature

The temperature is adjusted based on how creative you want your chatbot to be while answering the questions. It’s recommended to set the temperature on 0.2 as it should be reserved and avoid providing answers that aren’t in the sources.

### Leads 

This page is responsible for collecting Lead information from your users. This form appears after the first response generated by the bot.

You can configure a combination of the three fields (Name, Email, Phone number). You can also configure the message that shows on top of the Lead form from this page, along with the label for each of the collected fields.

This form is optional so your user can choose to not fill it and will continue receiving responses from the bot. You can also configure more advanced behavior for the lead form using the Actions tab.

This is how the lead form appears in the chat :

### Notifications 

From this page, you can configure the notifications you get from the bot. You can either opt for getting one email per day that contains all the leads submitted for that day. You can also opt for another email that sends you a daily email with the conversations done on that day. 

You can add multiple email addresses to receive these emails if needed

### Webhooks 

On this page, you can configure a webhook to trigger based on a selected action.

Currently, the available action is “lead submitted.” When a new lead is submitted through your bot’s lead form, our system automatically triggers the webhook.

The webhook sends a POST request to your chosen API, including the conversation ID and lead form data (name, email, and phone number).

You can use this to automate workflows with third-party tools by capturing the webhook and using it to send messages or perform other actions.

### Custom Domain

On this page, you can configure your chatbot to integrate with your own domain. This allows you to hide the Chatbase branding, making it appear as if the chatbot is built entirely by your team rather than using a third-party tool.

To set this up, enter the desired URL for your bot, and then configure a DNS record with your provider. Common DNS providers include Cloudflare, OpenDNS, and Quad9. 

You will need to add a CNAME record with the specific values provided on the custom domain page in your dashboard. Please note that it may take up to 6 hours for the records to fully propagate and update.
