# Plans

This tab shows you information about all the currently available plans, and allows you to make changes to your plan, or add new add-ons.

### Available Plans

This section displays all available plans for subscription. You can switch between monthly and yearly  by toggling the option. It's important to note that subscribing annually lets you pay for 10 months instead of 12.

If you choose to downgrade to a lower plan, such as from Unlimited to Hobby, the downgrade will take effect immediately. You'll receive a prorated credit based on the remaining time on your current plan, which will be applied to your new plan and any future invoices until the credit is used up.

Clicking "Cancel Plan" under your active plan disables auto-renewal. Your current plan will remain active until the next renewal date, after which you'll be downgraded to the free plan to avoid further charges.

***Note :*** Legacy plan users may not see the "Cancel Plan" button, as their active plan won't be listed. To downgrade to the free plan, please contact [support@chatbase.co](mailto:support@chatbase.co).
