# How to add the AI agent to my website?

To integrate the chatbot into your website, you have three primary methods to choose from:

### Iframe

By using this method, you can seamlessly embed the chatbot across multiple pages by simply adding the iframe code to the desired locations. Once embedded, the chatbot will remain visible and accessible on those specific pages, offering users a consistent and uninterrupted experience as they navigate through your site.

The iframe will be static, meaning the chatbot will always be open and readily available for visitors on the pages where it’s been included. This ensures that users can engage with the chatbot anytime without needing to interact with any additional pop-ups or triggers, enhancing usability and engagement.

### Chat bubble

Using this method, you can embed the chat bubble in the bottom left corner of your selected pages. The chat bubble remains visible and easily accessible, providing a consistent user experience across your website. When clicked, it opens a floating chat window, allowing users to engage in a conversation without navigating away from the page.

The chat window can be minimized by clicking the button again, making the bubble return to its initial position in the corner. This feature ensures that the chatbot remains unobtrusive, offering users a seamless and convenient way to communicate while they continue browsing your site.

### API calls

Using API calls, you can integrate the chatbot with your custom user interface, providing complete flexibility in how the chatbot is presented. By implementing the necessary API calls, you can customize the look and feel of the chatbot, while maintaining seamless communication with the bot’s backend.

This approach allows you to build and design a fully tailored chat experience that aligns with your brand and user interface preferences. You can send and receive messages, control bot behavior, and integrate advanced features, all while ensuring the chatbot integrates smoothly with your existing system and design.
