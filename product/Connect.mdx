# Connect 

This section in the chatbot shows how you can integrate the bot with your website, or even add it as an integration to Messenger or WhatsApp or many more!

## Embed

We have two main ways of embedding the chatbot to your website, the iframe or the widget.

The iframe adds a static component to your website which has the chat interface. This iframe cant be minimized or closed.

The widget adds a bubble icon to the bottom right corner of your website. When you press this button a chat window will appear and you can use it to send messages to your bot and you can press the same button again to minimize the chat window once again.

## Share

This tab allows you to find a url for the iframe of the bot, showing a full screen of the chatbot in case you would like to send it for your colleagues to test or even use the bot! 

Note: This link is generated using the Custom domains if it was configured. If not, it will be the base url for the iframe.
