This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to connect your chatbot to Messenger for your facebook pages, ensuring smooth and effective customer interactions.

## The Human Takeover Feature

The human takeover feature allows you to takeover the chat whenever you would like and chat with users yourself! It works on a conversation level meaning you would be able to choose a specific conversation from the dashboard and stop the chatbot from answering that conversation.



**Note:** some conversations may not have the human takeover icon, that happens when you delete a page from the integrations dashboard, you would still have access to your conversations in the chat logs, but since the integration was deleted you will not have access to the takeover feature since this page's integration was deleted. This will also happen if you delete a page and add it again, so be careful when deleting pages from the messenger dashboard.



#### to enable human takeover for a specific conversation:

1\. Navigate to Activity either through the Navbar or through the messenger dashboard.

2\. in the **Chat logs section** make sure to show only messenger chats.
