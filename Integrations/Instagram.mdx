## The Human Takeover Feature

The human takeover feature allows you to takeover the chat whenever you would like and chat with users yourself! It works on a conversation level meaning you would be able to choose a specific conversation from the dashboard and stop the chatbot from answering that conversation.



**Note:** some conversations may not have the human takeover icon, that happens when you delete a page from the integrations dashboard, you would still have access to your conversations in the chat logs, but since the integration was deleted you will not have access to the takeover feature since this page's integration was deleted. This will also happen if you delete a page and add it again, so be careful when deleting pages from the Instagram dashboard.



#### to enable human takeover for a specific conversation:

1\. Navigate to Activity either through the Navbar or through the messenger dashboard.

2\. in the **Chat logs section** make sure to show only Instagram chats.

2\. Click the **Manage** button to navigate to the dashboard. If you want to connect another chatbot to an already connected page, click,**** then delete the page.

3\. Navigate to the chatbot you want to integrate to the page deleted, then reinitialize the integrations steps.
