2\. Click on **Invite Them**. The chatbot will then be available in the channel to answer any questions you might have.

## Step 4: Start Chatting!

That's it! Your Chatbase chatbot is now integrated and ready to elevate team communication in your Slack workspace.

Anytime you or any member of your team needs a question answered, just type @chatbase followed by your question, and your chatbot will respond.
